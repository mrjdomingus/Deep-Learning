    "grows a neural network as an ensemble of subnetworks that minimizes the AdaNet\n",
    "objective (a.k.a. AdaNet loss):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(w) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\Phi \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{N}w_jh_j(x_i), y_i \\right) + \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left(\\lambda r(h_j) + \\beta \\right) |w_j| $$\n",

    "function for measuring a subnetwork's complexity, and $\\lambda$ and $\\beta$\n",
    "are hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mixture weights\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are mixture weights? When forming an ensemble $f$ of subnetworks $h$,\n",
    "we need to somehow combine the their predictions. This is done by multiplying\n",
    "the outputs of subnetwork $h_i$ with mixture weight $w_i$, and summing the\n",
    "results:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N}w_jh_j(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, most commonly used set of mixture weight is **uniform average\n",
    "weighting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N}h_j(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can also solve a convex optimization problem to learn the mixture\n",
    "weights that minimize the loss function $\\Phi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(w) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\Phi \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{N}w_jh_j(x_i), y_i \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first term in the AdaNet objective. The second term applies L1\n",
    "regularization to the mixture weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left(\\lambda r(h_j) + \\beta \\right) |w_j|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $\\lambda > 0$ this penalty serves to prevent the optimization from\n",
    "assigning too much weight to more complex subnetworks according to the\n",
    "complexity measure function $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How AdaNet uses the objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This objective function serves two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  To **learn to scale/transform the outputs of each subnetwork $h$** as part\n",
    "    of the ensemble.\n",
    "2.  To **select the best candidate subnetwork $h$** at each AdaNet iteration\n",
    "    to include in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, when learning mixture weights $w$, AdaNet solves a convex\n",
    "combination of the outputs of the frozen subnetworks $h$. For $\\lambda >0$,\n",
    "AdaNet penalizes more complex subnetworks with greater L1 regularization on\n",
    "their mixture weight, and will be less likely to select more complex subnetworks\n",
    "to add to the ensemble at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, in you will observe the benefits of using AdaNet to learn the\n",
    "ensemble's mixture weights and to perform candidate selection.\n",

    "In this tutorial, you were able to explore training an AdaNet model's mixture\n",
    "weights with $\\lambda \\ge 0$. You were also able to compare against building an\n",
    "ensemble formed by always choosing the best candidate subnetwork at each\n",
    "iteration based on it's ability to improve the ensemble's loss on the training\n",
    "set, and averaging their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform average ensembles work unreasonably well in practice, yet learning the\n",
    "mixture weights with the correct values of $\\lambda$ and $\\beta$ should always\n",
    "produce a better model when candidates have varying complexity. However, this\n",
    "does require some additional hyperparameter tuning, so practically you can train\n",
    "an AdaNet with the default mixture weights and $\\lambda=0$ first, and once you\n",
    "have confirmed that the subnetworks are training correctly, you can tune the\n",
    "mixture weight hyperparameters.\n",

    "While this example explored a regression task, these observations apply to using\n",
